This is the code for our paper "Asynchronous Decentralized Traffic Signal Coordinated Control in Urban Road Network".

This study introduces an Asynchronous Decentralized Coordinated Signal Control (ADCSC) framework for multi-agent traffic signal control in the urban road network. The controller at each intersection in the network optimizes its signal control decisions based on prediction of the future traffic demand as an independent agent. The asynchronous framework decouples the entangled interdependence between decision-making and state prediction among different agents in decentralized coordinated decision-making problems, enabling agents to proceed with collaborative decision-making without waiting for other agents' decisions. Within the proposed ADCSC framework, each controller dynamically optimizes its signal timing strategy with a unique rolling horizon scheme. The scheme's individualized parameters for each controller are determined based on the vehicle travel time between the adjacent intersections, ensuring that controllers can make informed control decisions with accurate arrival flow information from upstream intersections. The signal optimization problem is formulated as a mixed integer linear program model, which adopts a flexible signal scheme without a fixed phase structure and sequence.

This code is a demo experiment in a 2x2 road network.
